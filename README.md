# Remote-Controller

Telecommunications research project using the MQTT protocol. The goal of this project was to create a method to control a vehicle wirelessly. The MQTT protocol is a clean, fast solution to this problem. While this code does not control an actual vehicle, it simulates the vehicle with a graphics that copy how the joystick itself moces. 

This folder includes:

- joystick (ground station) GUI that can be used with the up,down,left,right arrow keys as well as the 'w' 'a' 's' 'd' keys. 

- joystick reciever (Vehicle) code that takes in the data sent by th joystick GUI and mimics th output

- encryption techniques to make sure only verified people can use the joystick.

For more information on how to use this code, see instructions.md
